# Bootcamp Website
This is one of my favourite projects. This projects is about building a Front End Website for a Bootcamp and uses the latest Bootstrap 5.
This is also a good project to get your hanbds on for understanding how Bootstrap 5 works and how we can leverage it to make beautiful and mobile responsive websites.
Please feel free to have it and customize it in your own way to make it look more elegant and amazing.
